It's January 6th 2014.

Whether you want to be a software developer or...

You want to build a business with software or...

You just want to understand how software works...

Collective Academy will help you reach your goals.

Our plan is to...

Use the best available online resources to get you started

And make sure that you master each topic before we move on.

We will then do a series of one-day group challenges.

And end with group projects chosen by you.

We have 30 days together...

But this course is just the beginning.
