Collective Academy is a new initiative of Camden Town Unlimited and it aims to provide training in software development to people who have little or no experience in programming, but are very motivated to learn.

In January 2014, we are running a six-week, full-time pilot course in "Coding for the web", which is available for free to anyone who is willing to apply, although spaces are strictly limited and priority is being given to Camden residents and Camden school or college leavers.

Candidates have a few days left to apply for the pilot course. Alternatively, they can express an interest in subsequent part-time and full-time versions of the course that we are planning for later in the year.

The Collective Academy is based in Camden Town, London.

More information about the course and the application form is at http://camdencollective.co.uk/academy/.

The curriculum is being developed by Dan Sofer of selforganising.org, who can be contacted at academy@selforganising.org.

Collective Academy is being sponsored by Camden Town Unlimited who can be  contacted at...
