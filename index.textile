dt. Self-organising
  
dd. From January 2013, we met at the British Library for a series of study groups on a wide range of subjects, including game theory, data science, functional programming, cryptography and statistics. Over the course of 2014, Self-organising morphed into what now has become "_Founders &amp; Coders_":http://foundersandcoders.org/.
