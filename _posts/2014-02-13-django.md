Part 1. (Part 2 tomorrow).

#####Start with the AppEngine Hello World app

    git clone git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-django-skeleton.git
    cd appengine-django-skeleton
    ./build.sh
(wait a minute)

    ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3000

[Here is the GitHub repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-django-skeleton))

Today's task:

* Just look at all those bloody files!
* Track down the main application file that handles page requests
* Preview the home page of the site
* Track down the template for the home page
* Can you work out how the routing works for the home page?
* And where is the home page handler?
