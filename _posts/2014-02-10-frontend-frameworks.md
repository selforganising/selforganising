####Task: style your blog using a frontend framework

#####Download the frameworks

    mkdir frameworks
    curl -O https://gist.github.com/sofer/8902360/raw/8cc1c1aec43b9081792fff567b95a2cd5803531d/foundation.html
    curl -O https://gist.github.com/sofer/8906628/raw/4c74d5dd82aacf9ff515486780c7c2fdc2f90e97/bootstrap.html 
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000

And have a play with the two downloaded files, which are edited versions of demo pages for each framework that will function without needing to download any further files.

#####Take a look at the online docs

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html)

Pay particular attention to the way grids are laid out. Ignore anything that you do not understand after the second or third reading. A lot of the details are really not necessary to get the gist of how these frameworks work.

#####Decide which framework you prefer

You may want to try a Google search for e.g. _foundation vs bootstrap_.

#####Finally, style your blog using one of the two frameworks

For the end-of-day review:

* Which framework did you prefer and why?
* How does your blog now look?
