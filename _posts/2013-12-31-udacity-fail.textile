One of the main lines of thought with the Collective Academy is that 

however important expertise is, peers matter more.

Cleverness is over-rated.

We want to be as open as we can possibly with our intake, but pretty brutal in rejecting people who aren't prepared to share our ethos of mutual support and collaboration. We don't care where you come from and what your qualification are, but what we cannot tolerate is people who aren't prepared to work hard and pull their weight.

Startup culture

It you want work, employ yourself. If you want skills, teach yourself. And if you want to go somewhere, share the journey.
