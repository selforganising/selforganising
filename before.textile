h2. Pre-course assignment

If you have any time spare between now and the start of the course, please go to _Codecademy_: and try out:

* "Web Fundamentals":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web

And if you are feeling adventurous:

* "jQuery":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
* "Javascript":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
* "Projects":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects

None of this material is essential at the beginning of the course, but as wet pick up speed, you will need to become familiar with HTML, JavaScript and JQuery, so if you make a start beforehand, you will have less work to do in January.

If you find yourself having difficulty with any of the material or want to discuss it, please <a href="mailto:academy@selforganising.org" target="_blank">get in touch</a>.
