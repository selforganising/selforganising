h3. draft

h2. Pre-course assignment

If you have any time spare between now and January 6th, please go to "Codecademy": and try out:

* "Web Fundamentals":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web

And if you are feeling adventurous:

* "Codecademy: jQuery":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
* "Codecademy: Javascript":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
* "Codecademy: Projects":http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/projects

None of this material is essential at the beginning of the course, but as it picks up speed, you will need to become familiar with HTML, JavaScript and JQuery, so if you make a start beforehand, you will have less work to do in January.

h2. Accounts

Please set up accounts with the following services, if you have not done so already:

* Gmail
* Linkedin
* Facebook
* Twitter 
* Github

You may also want to follow "@selforganising":https://twitter.com/selforganising.

h2. Equipment

If you have your own laptop computer, please bring it. Otherwise, please let us know, and we will provide you with one for the duration of the course.

h2. Questions

If you have any doubts or questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the course tutor.
